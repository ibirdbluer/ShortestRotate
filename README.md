# ShortestRotate
a demo for a test
There're 9 numbers in a 3 x 3 plane. We could only clockwise or counterclockwise rotate the four tiles around one of the four points, I II III and IV. R1, R2, R3, R4 and r1, r2, r3, r4 are corresponding to the 8 kinds of rotation, where we mark clockwise rotations as r and counterclockwise rotations as R. For example, starting from configuration (S), by the rotation sequence r1R4r2R3 we reach the configuration (E). Now, starting from configuration (S), find the shortest way to reach configuration (T).
